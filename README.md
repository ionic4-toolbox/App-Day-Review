# day-review
Day review is an ionic app to review daily activity. It is used for self growth and learning.
You could review what went good today, what could have gone better, and what did you learn from it. There is also a space for entering what new did you learn today both professionally and personally. You could also have a mindful review were you write how you feel physically and emotionally. You can write what all things you are grateful for and what creative things you did for the day.
This is my first Ionic App (Android).
